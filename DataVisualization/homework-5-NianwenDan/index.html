                <p>The visualization indicates that the company prefers to pay less as the number of immigrants increases. The statistics show that an excessive number of immigrants may impact the rate at which U.S. job salaries increase.</p>

                The number of immigrants <strong>does not</strong> impact United States job market
                <svg id="unemployment_svg"></svg>
                <hr>
                <p>The visualization indicates that the overall unemployment rate is not affected by the number of immigrants. The statistics show that there is no direct relationship between the number of immigrants and the overall unemployment rate.</p>

        <h3>About the dataset</h3>
        <p>This dataset is from kaggle where it contains the following attributes:
            <ul>
                <li>Year</li>
                <li>Immigrants Obtaining Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) Status</li>
                <li>Unemployment Rate</li>
                <li>Wages (USD)</li>
            </ul>
            Since the Immigrants LPR and Wages are actual value, I calculated the change rate for these 2 attributes.
            The dataset can be found <a href="https://kaggle.com/datasets/362f9025c807ee46fce4367b7139a8061b2c11706e37e81a15a4c3453a2e0aa9">here</a>.

        <h3>The arguments</h3>
        <h4>Left Image</h4>
        <p>The visualization uses clear presentation of data to show the relationship between an increasing number of immigrants and impact on U.S. wages change rate.
            The visualization implies the company prefer to lower the salaries increasing rate as the immigrants grows. Because they can find cheap labor.
        </p>
        <p>The rhetorical framing techniques used in the left chart are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Omission: The graph does not address external factors (e.g., economic inflation, industry-specific changes) that might influence wages. It isolates the relationship between immigration and wages to drive home the argument.</li>
            <li>Anchoring: The visualization draws the viewer's attention to the apparent inverse correlation between immigrants and wage rates, leading the audience to focus on the connection.</li>
            <li>Comparison: By juxtaposing trends in wages and immigration rates, the graph suggests a cause-and-effect relationship, reinforcing the argument.</li>
            <li>Exaggeration: The change in wages is highlighted in a way that makes the decrease seem more dramatic, potentially overemphasizing the visual impact of this relationship.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Right Image</h4>
        <p>The visualization demonstrates the overall unemployment rate and its lack of connection with the number of immigrants. The graph shows that the overall unemployment rate decreases as the number of immigrants fluctuates.</p>
        <p>The rhetorical framing techniques used in the right chart are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Omission: This graph does not include data on industry-specific unemployment, focusing instead on overall unemployment to make a general claim.</li>
            <li>Anchoring: The graph's highlighted the lack of significant correlation, leading the viewer to conclude that immigration levels do not impact unemployment.</li>
            <li>Simplification: By reducing complex labor market dynamics into a single relationship, the visualization effectively communicates its argument but may overlook other factors.</li>
            <li>Axis Scaling: The steady line for unemployment rate plotted in a way that downplays minor variations, reinforcing the impression of stability.</li>
        </ul>
