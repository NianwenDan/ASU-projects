## üß† Project Description

**Phishy** is a Chrome browser extension that detects phishing websites in real time using machine learning and threat intelligence sources. Built as a course project for *CSE 543: Information Assurance and Security* at Arizona State University, this tool aims to provide users with an extra layer of protection against malicious websites.  

The extension checks URLs against Google Safe Browsing and uses a lightweight ONNX-based machine learning model to predict phishing intent based on structural and lexical features of the URL.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **Yarn**
- **Google Chrome**
- **Google Safe Browsing API key**  
  (You can obtain one for free from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/safebrowsing.googleapis.com))

### Installation Steps

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aad8ya/phishy.git
   cd phishy
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure the API Key**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:

     ```
     VITE_GOOGLE_API=your-api-key-here
     ```

4. **Build the Extension**

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
   This will generate a `dist/` folder containing the built extension.

## üìö Technical Documentation

### üîç Features

- **Automatic Phishing Check**  
  On every page load, the extension automatically checks the current URL for phishing threats.

- **Safe Browsing Integration**  
  URLs are cross-referenced with Google's Safe Browsing API.

- **ONNX Model Inference** 
  A sandboxed iframe will run an ONNX ML model for additional phishing detection based on URL patterns.

- **Popup Interface**  
  Displays URL status with a manual ‚ÄúRecheck‚Äù button.

- **Result Caching**  
  Uses `chrome.storage.local` to cache results with a 1-hour TTL and automatic pruning.

- **User Alerts**  
  Unsafe sites trigger a browser `alert()` for immediate user warning.
